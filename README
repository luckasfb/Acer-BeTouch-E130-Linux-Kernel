Modified kernel source code for Acer BeTouch E130. 

The kernel file from Acer lacks some #defines and doesn't contain
proper config file. I wanted to have ext3 support for debian chroot,
and I found out that there is a problem in the SDCard driver almost
everytime when I do apt-get install.

The modifications that I made so far are:

- created a config file that matches almost exactly with the old kernel symbol table (/proc/kallsyms)
- changed some values to match the dmesg in the original kernel
- added some #defines (TODO: should be merged to single .h file)
- changed pnxmci so that it wont do scatter gather, and use software based bounce buffer instead
